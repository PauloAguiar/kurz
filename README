kurz.go - a url shortener in go
--------------------------------

kurz.go is my attempt to write a program that is actually useful in go. Right
now it is in alpha stage, but will eventually grow into a the real thing.

Right now it can shorten URLs and redirect. All urls are stored in a redis
(http://redis.io) instance, that is assumed to be running on the same host on
the default port.


Compiling kurz.go
-----------------

Next to having a full install of go itself, kurz.go requires web.go and godis to
be installed. For installing go itself, please follow the fine instructions at
http://golang.org

For installing web.go do:

    $ git clone https://github.com/hoisie/web.go.git
    $ cd web.go
    $ make install (should work agains the latest weekly release)

for isntalling godis do:
    $ git clone https://github.com/simonz05/godis.git
    $ cd godis
    $ make install

Note: These modules will be installed into your $GOROOT, so make sure it is
writable.

Once the dependecies are installed, check out kurz.go:
    $ git https://github.com/fs111/kurz.go
    $ make
    $ ./kurz #assumes that redis is up and running

In order to shorten a url send it to http://localhost:9999/shorten/$url and in
return you will get the shortened URL. If you open that URL, it will do the
expected thing an redirect you to the original URL. 

All urls are stored in redis and if you set it up so, that it actually persists
file to disk, the state can be kept forever. Since there is no real state within
kurz.go, you could run multiple instances of it, but I have not tried it yet.

Testing it out
--------------
the stuff directory contains a shell-script that imports the csv file into
kurz.go. Just try it out!

Note: The csv file might contain some NSFW urls, I found it on the interwebs
somewhere. You have been warned.

Have fun with it!
